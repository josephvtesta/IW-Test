# IW-Test

Javascript Proficiency Quiz:

In the zip file named IW JS Quiz.zip you’ll find the following 4 files:
1.	index.html
2.	data.json
3.	default_view.png
4.	filterDropdown.png

Using the data.json file provided IW would like to see you create a similar page of HTML markup as shown in the screenshots  contained.

The data.json file contains a json object show in the example   below:
{
"vclala": {
"Devices": 5,
"Channels": 2
},
"ggrneied": {
"Devices": 1,
"Channels": 1
}
}

The keys (indicated in Red) of each object is an example title of a dataset contained within our system. In the screenshots provided you’ll notice these are displayed along the vertical axis on the left hand side of the  image.

The colored bars aside the title contains the number of Devices, and number of Channels, both which are contained within the json as child objects nodes attached to the   title.

At the top you’ll see a total count for each Devices and   Channels.
